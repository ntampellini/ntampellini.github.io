Hi! I am Nicol√≤ Tampellini, a Ph.D. student in synthetic and computational chemistry in the [lab of Prof. Miller](https://millerlab.yale.edu/) (Yale University). I focus on developing new asymmetric, catalytic methods and chiral catalysts to control selectivity in the formation of interesting chiral scaffolds. You can find my one-page resume [here](/assets/resume.pdf).

Welcome to my website[^style]! Here you can find posts about past and current projects and ideas, as well as interactive visualizations of molecular structures and other dynamic content.

Outside of the hood and the terminal, I enjoy rock climbing and playing different musical instruments, preferably with good friends.

Thanks for stopping by!
