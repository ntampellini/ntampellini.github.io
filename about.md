Hi! I am Nicol√≤ Tampellini, a Ph.D. student in synthetic and computational chemistry in the [lab of Prof. Miller](https://millerlab.yale.edu/) (Yale University). I focus on developing asymmetric, catalytic reactions to target pharmaceutically interesting chiral scaffolds. You can find my one-page resume [here](/assets/resume.pdf).

This is my personal website[^style] where I will post about my projects and ideas. The main goal is to have a place where I can easily share ideas and interactive visualizations of molecular structures and other dynamic content.

Outside of the hood and the terminal, I enjoy rock climbing and playing different musical instruments, much preferably with good friends.

Thanks for stopping by!

_Nick_
