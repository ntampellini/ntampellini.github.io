As my first PhD project in the lab of Prof. Miller, we developed an atroposelective imidation catalyst able to provide axially chiral quinazolinediones. The manuscript is currently in review and can be read on ChemRXiv[^chemrxiv]. Following a series of structure-activity relationships we observed, we obtained a selective and specific catalyst featuring novel key elements. Intrigued by the scaffold, we decided to take a deep dive into the reaction mechanism with the help of DFT. [...]

We discovered that our catalyst [...]

Our modeling unveiled the importance of a difluoroacetyl moiety in selectively engaging as a _bidentate_ hydrogen bond donor in the transition states leading to the _major_ enantiomer (S<sub>a</sub>), while only acting as _monodentate_ in the disfavored pathway to the _minor_ (R<sub>a</sub>). Here you can find some interactive renderings of the relevant transition states, where you can observe this behavior.

In the second transition state the situation is the same, and the _major_ enantiomer (S<sub>a</sub>) is formed via an activation mode that features bidentate coordination of the difluoroacetamide moiety. The _minor_ enantiomer once again only features monodentate coordination in the transition state (TS2 R<sub>a</sub>).
